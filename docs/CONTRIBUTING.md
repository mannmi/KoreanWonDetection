## Write Code
To setup the Project you may find the installment guide useful : [Instal Guide](./INSTAL.md) 

* Please ensure that the issue has not been addressed in an existing Pull Request
* Check if an Issue has been created in the issue tracker, if not create a new one.
* Don't create duplicate issues
* Changes that are larger (nontrivial) should be discussed in an issue first 
* Features are to be developed in Topic Branches not the main.
* The main branch is to be used for releases only
* Pull Request have to contain full comprehensible description 
* Pull Request should link to issues (this simplifies the process of connecting pullrequest and issues)

## Reporting Bugs

This Project is still in its infancy so No unit testing standards have been set as of now
This will be remedied as son as possible.

## Well formated commit messages.
See Commit Message Style link : [COMMIT MESSAGE Style](COMMIT_MESSAGE.md)

## Write Documentation

To ensure our codebase is well-documented and easy to understand, please follow these guidelines:

Generate Doxygen Comments:
Use Doxygen to create inline documentation for all functions, classes, and methods.
Ensure comments are clear, concise, and provide enough detail for others to understand the purpose and usage of the code.

Inline Documentation:
Add inline comments to explain complex logic or important sections of the code.

Use consistent formatting and style for all comments.

Wiki Entries:
For significant code additions or changes, create a corresponding wiki entry.
The wiki entry should include an overview of the code, its purpose, and any important details or usage instructions.
