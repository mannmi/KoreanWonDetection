## Recommended Algorithms

Within the `src` folder, we recommend focusing on two primary algorithm directories:

### 1. **Image Template Matching**  
- **Location**: `src/image_template_matching`  
- **Purpose**: Detecting and recognizing Korean Won note features using template matching techniques.  

### 2. **Edge Detection**  
- **Location**: `src/edge_detection`  
- **Purpose**: Identifying boundaries and key features of currency images.
