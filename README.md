# Korean Won Detection

This project uses OpenCV to identify different currencies from images. It leverages computer vision techniques to detect and classify various banknotes and coins (korean won).

## Features

- Detects and identifies different won from images (webcam feed)
- Easy to extend with additional currencies

## Philosophy

The philosophy behind Korean Won Detection is built on accuracy, reliability, and adaptability, ensuring the tool meets diverse user needs effectively.

- Accuracy as Priority:
This project must identify the Korean Won symbol (â‚©) with precision, minimizing false positives or negatives. It should handle various contexts, such as text, numerical data, or mixed symbols.

- Reliability Across Platforms:
Consistent performance across environments is essential. This can be achieved through comprehensive testing and resilience against diverse input formats.

- Adaptability for Growth:
The detection system should allow for future enhancements, such as detecting additional symbols or integrating with larger financial systems.

- User-Friendly Design:
Clear APIs and documentation will ensure ease of use and integration, encouraging broader currency adoption and contribution.

- Community to Commercial:
Distribute to many users for educational purposes, and if projects and Discord are activated later, some functions are supplemented to take care of commercial purposes together
